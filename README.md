Many robots today use a screen as its face [[1](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3171286)], so let's turn your tablet into a robot! The super simple robot face provided here is inspired by [Doug's nameless robot](http://www.ezmicro.com/robot/images/EyesPlus1_001.jpg) and meant to express [basic emotions](http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm) or act like [emojis](https://blog.emojipedia.org/whatsapp-unveils-its-own-emojis/). One day, I hope to provide APIs for creating additive robot behaviors [explained by Doug](http://www.ezmicro.com/robot/index.html) ([an example robot addiive body language chart](http://www.ezmicro.com/robot/flowWake.bmp)).
